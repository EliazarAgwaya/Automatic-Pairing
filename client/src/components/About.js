    <p >We provide a  solution to the pairing  problem. For 
        the teachers, leaders,lectures and other groups 
          who are involved in dealing   with users 
         or people, this  system is for 
          you. It allows you to automatically put people 
            into pairs and keep track 
             of the pairs at just a click 
             of a button. 
This gives efficiency in 
dealing with large number 
 of people.</p>
